Phase 0: Setup & Configuration Foundation
•	config_v2_5.json & config.schema.v2.5.json:
o	Crucial Change: Design the configuration to support per-symbol (or per-asset-class) overrides.
	Instead of just global settings for (e.g.) dag_alpha or regime_rules, allow sections like:
	"symbol_specific_overrides": {
	    "SPY": {
	        "market_regime_engine_settings": { /* SPY-specific regime rules */ },
	        "strategy_settings": { /* SPY-specific conviction mods, target multipliers */ }
	    },
	    "AAPL": {
	        "data_processor_settings": { /* Different MSPI weights for AAPL? */ },
	        "strategy_settings": { /* Different ATR multipliers for AAPL */ }
	    },
	    "DEFAULT": { /* Settings for any ticker not explicitly listed */ }
}

Use code with caution.Json
	Your ConfigManagerV2_5.get_setting would then need to be intelligent enough to look for symbol_specific_overrides.TARGET_SYMBOL.path.to.key first, then fall back to symbol_specific_overrides.DEFAULT.path.to.key, and finally to the global setting.
o	The metrics_for_dynamic_threshold_distribution_tracking might need to be configurable per symbol if different metrics are key for different underlyings.
Phase 1: Data Layer Enhancements
•	fetcher_convexvalue_v2_5.py & fetcher_tradier_v2_5.py: These are generally ticker-agnostic already, which is good.
•	historical_data_manager_v2_5.py & performance_tracker_v2_5.py: Ensure file storage paths can accommodate different symbols easily (e.g., data_cache/historical_metric_store/SPY/metric_name.parquet, data_cache/historical_metric_store/AAPL/metric_name.parquet).
Phase 2: Core Metrics Calculation
•	metrics_calculator_v2_5.py:
o	The fundamental calculation logic for A-DAG, E-SDAG, VAPI-FA, DWFD, TW-LAF, SGDHP data, etc., should be universal. These metrics are derived from options greeks and flow, which are common to all options.
o	However, the parameters used in these calculations (e.g., specific coefficients, lookback periods for normalization within VAPI-FA, ATR periods) should be configurable and potentially overridden per symbol via the enhanced config_v2_5.json.
Phase 3: Contextual Engines
•	spyspx_optimizer_v2_5.py:
o	Rename/Refactor Conceptually: This becomes more of a ticker_context_analyzer_v2_5.py or asset_specific_analyzer_v2_5.py.
o	Logic:
	It would still handle SPY/SPX expiration/intraday patterns as a special case if "SPY" or "SPX" is the target.
	For other tickers, it might have simpler logic (e.g., just standard DTE calculation, basic earnings flags if you add that data source, identifying if it's a highly liquid stock vs. a thinner one).
	The output spyspx_context dictionary would become a more generic asset_context dictionary.
•	market_regime_engine_v2_5.py:
o	The MRE rules in config_v2_5.json for the "DEFAULT" symbol profile would contain general regime definitions (e.g., "Low Volatility Consolidation," "High Momentum Breakout").
o	The "SPY" override section could have additional or more specific regime rules that are particularly relevant to SPY/SPX index dynamics (e.g., "0DTE Vanna Squeeze Potential - SPX").
o	The MRE would load the appropriate set of rules based on the target symbol.
•	key_level_identifier_v2_5.py: The core logic of identifying S/R from A-MSPI, NVP, SGDHP, UGCH is universal. Ticker-specific parameters might influence the strength scoring or conviction thresholds for these levels.
Phase 4: Signal Generation & ATIF
•	signal_generator_v2_5.py:
o	Signal definitions should be universal (e.g., a "strong VAPI-FA bullish surge" signal).
o	The thresholds for triggering these signals and their initial scores should be configurable per symbol profile in config_v2_5.json.
•	adaptive_trade_idea_framework_v2_5.py (ATIF):
o	Core ATIF Logic (Universal): The mechanisms for dynamic signal integration, performance-based conviction mapping, and intelligent recommendation management are generalizable.
o	Ticker-Specific Performance Profiles: The PerformanceTrackerV2_5 would store performance data per symbol. So, the ATIF's "learning" (adjusting signal weights, conviction maps) would be specific to the historical performance on that particular ticker or its asset class. This is key.
o	Strategy Specificity Rules (Ticker-Aware): The rules within ATIF that map [regime + signal profile + context] to option strategies could have default versions and then ticker-specific overrides. For example, for highly volatile meme stocks, it might favor wider spreads or different DTEs than for SPY.
•	trade_parameter_optimizer_v2_5.py:
o	ATR calculations are inherently ticker-specific.
o	The S/R levels it uses will come from the (potentially ticker-parameterized) KeyLevelIdentifierV2_5.
o	ATR multipliers for targets/stops should definitely be configurable per symbol profile in config_v2_5.json.
Phase 5 & 6: Orchestration, UI, and Refinement
•	its_orchestrator_v2_5.py: Will need to load the correct symbol-specific override configurations for each component it initializes or calls.
•	Dashboard: When a symbol is selected, the dashboard would ideally load and display data using parameters and potentially visualization styles (e.g., y-axis ranges for flow metrics) tailored to that symbol's typical behavior.
Plan of Attack Adjustment for Broader Applicability:
The phased approach remains largely the same, but with an emphasis on configurability and default/override logic at each step:
1.	Config First: Design config_v2_5.json and ConfigManagerV2_5 with the symbol override structure from the outset. Define a "DEFAULT" profile.
2.	Universal Metric Logic: When building MetricsCalculatorV2_5, ensure the formulas are universal, and all specific parameters (coefficients, lookbacks) are pulled from the config (which will apply the correct symbol profile).
3.	General Context Analyzer: Frame the spyspx_optimizer_v2_5.py as a more general asset_context_analyzer_v2_5.py that has special modules/logic for SPY/SPX but can provide basic context (like DTE, upcoming earnings if data is available) for any ticker.
4.	Tiered Regime Rules: Develop a base set of market regime rules in the "DEFAULT" profile. Add SPY/SPX-specific refinements in its override section.
5.	ATIF with Per-Symbol Learning: The PerformanceTrackerV2_5 is crucial here. It must store performance data tagged by symbol. The ATIF then uses this symbol-specific history.
6.	Initial Tuning for SPY/SPX: While the framework is general, your initial tuning of thresholds, strategy rules, and ATIF parameters will likely be focused on SPY/SPX. This is fine – it's your primary target.
7.	Later Expansion to Other Tickers: Once v2.5 is lethal on SPY/SPX, expanding to other tickers involves:
o	Creating new symbol profiles in config_v2_5.json if they need different parameters than "DEFAULT".
o	Letting the ATIF build up a performance history for those new tickers over time.
